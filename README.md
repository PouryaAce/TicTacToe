# Tic Tac Toe

tic tac toe is a game that plays between two players theres total of nine boxes and each player get to pick a box , when a player have 3 boxes in a row 
they win.
2 players are usually defined with X and O

## Approach to problm (planning)

first wee need to make grid template with 3 rows and columns,
then target each box individually that when click happens it appears X or O
give each X and O on time to run each time
if we have 3 similair items each row X or O wins

## Cool tech used

i was inspired by God of War game which i recently just finished i used a wallpaper from the game , main soundtrack of the game and usued similair fonts that were used in the game

## Lessons you learnt
learnt the importance of planning , basically how to make the game from scratch 
learnt new ways to tackle problems and got familiar the language of java script
html and css and how to use all 3 at the same time to develop a fully functional game

## Future features (things to add if i have time )

definately add a press play and stop icon
